This repository showcases a complete set of AI/ML tasks developed as part of my internship program. The work spans key domains of artificial intelligence, including data preprocessing, machine learning, natural language processing, and deep learning. Each task is implemented using industry-standard Python libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-Learn, NLTK, spaCy, and TensorFlow.

The project includes:

🔹 Task 1 — Data Preprocessing  
    - Handling missing values  
    - Encoding categorical variables  
    - Scaling numeric features  
    - Feature engineering  
    - Exporting clean datasets  

🔹 Task 2 — Machine Learning Model  
    - Training Decision Tree & Logistic Regression classifiers  
    - Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV)  
    - Generating accuracy scores, confusion matrices, and model reports  
    - Saving the best-performing model automatically  

🔹 Task 3 — Natural Language Processing  
    - Rule-based sentiment analysis with NLTK VADER  
    - Supervised machine learning using TF-IDF + Logistic Regression  
    - Text cleaning and lemmatization using spaCy  
    - Evaluation metrics and prediction examples  

🔹 Task 4 — Image Classification  
    - Building and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)  
    - MNIST handwritten digit classification  
    - Training visualization and model saving  
    - Sample predictions generation  

This repository demonstrates strong skills in AI development, data analysis, and ML pipeline construction, and serves as a complete portfolio-ready project for internships or academic submissions.
